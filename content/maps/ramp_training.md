**ramp_training** is a map designed to help assist new players in getting familiar with the *ramping* mechanic in Team Fortress Classic.

The map features four types of ramp styles:

* **Low** - players crouch after hitting the ramp
* **Distance** - players get as much speed as they can and hit the jump
* **High** - players use circle-strafing mechanics to get as much height as possible
* **Strafe** - players strafe around obstacles after hitting the ramp
