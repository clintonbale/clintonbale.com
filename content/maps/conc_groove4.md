**conc_groove4** is a collaboration map between *Spaz* and myself. This map is a continuation of the original conc\_groove series by *Sand le Youkoulaylay*. The map features 10 moderate-hard jumps using the same style as the original series.

The map is also equipped with an experts and masters team for experienced concers to try their hand at. These teams must link jumps together and cannot touch the ground between jumps.
