**concmap_od** is a map that is an output of a self-challenge I gave to myself: "Can I develop a map in **o**ne **d**ay?" The map is named after the challenge (**od** for one day).

Before beginning this map I chose on a simple style to avoid getting caught up in a mess of textures or crazy geometry. The style consists of a few parts:

* 64x64 unit minimum block size. This keeps the geometry simple
* Gray square texture for floor, white for walls
* Edges and borders of geometry must be clipped for lighting. 
* Map lighting is all texture based. This reduces time spent illuminating the map properly.
* *Skybox* is a flat white texture, with texture lights. To keep things in style.

Overall the map took me 8 hours to complete within the constraints above.
