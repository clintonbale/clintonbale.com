**clintonbale.com** is a result of two things: being sick of WordPress and the bloat that comes with it, and the curiosity that static website generation has given me ever since I have first heard of it.

The website is created using the latest version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/clintonbale/clintonbale.com). I have also based this template based on the Hugo theme [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo)

The site is built to simply have some virtual presence. I will be updating the blog and other sections as I develop content.
